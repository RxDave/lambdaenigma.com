# Lambda Enigma

I'm currently working on a full desktop version of this game, which I plan to release on Steam in early 2025.

As a result, I've temporarily taken down the website (http://lambdaenigma.com) which ran the old online version of the game. When I find the time, I'll relaunch the website with a "coming soon" banner or something, and a link to the public Steam store page for the game, once I've made the store page live.

## About the Game

**A picture puzzle has a frame. And it has pieces. The pieces are part of a larger picture. The player composes the pieces together into an arrangement that fits within the frame and correctly forms the intended picture.**

_This repo is currently just a placeholder. I may decide to use it to publish solutions to puzzles, perhaps as standalone snippets or as complete runnable programs. Perhaps in the future I may even publish the source code for the web app itself._
